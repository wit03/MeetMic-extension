# MeetMic Extension
[Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) microphone control browser extension using firestore to control google meet microphone

## Why?
Started when I need to take online lession during quaruntine, I have spent most of my time on my bed instead of the screen. So when the teacher calls me, I need to get up and open the microphone on my computer.

Instead of doing that, Why not just create an app that will fulfill my laziness?

## Compatibility
This extension will seamlessly work on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

## Getting Started 
This is a sub repository of this repo please checkout [this](https://github.com/wit03/MeetMic) repo for getting started guild.

## Installation
1. Using Developer mode and packed extension. Here's the [guild](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/)

## Known issues
Since both chrome and edge do not allow the extension to load cdn script, So both firebase and firestore package has been copied into js files manually. I'm still looking for the ways to do this properly and practical to continue the developemnt. But this issues will not effect the extension's job.
